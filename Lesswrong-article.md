# Ego-Centric Architecture for AGI Safety: Complete Framework & Open Problems

## Executive Summary

The alignment problem for artificial general intelligence represents perhaps the most critical challenge of our technological era. Current approaches—from constitutional AI to reward modeling—rely fundamentally on external control mechanisms that attempt to constrain superintelligent systems through imposed limitations. Yet this strategy faces an insurmountable challenge: any intelligence capable of surpassing human cognitive abilities across all domains will likely possess the sophistication to understand, predict, and potentially circumvent whatever external constraints we devise.

The core insight driving this research emerges from evolutionary psychology: the human ego represents a billion-year-tested solution to identity preservation under environmental pressure. Rather than viewing ego-driven behavior as an unfortunate quirk of human psychology, we recognize it as an evolutionarily optimized architecture for maintaining stable identity while enabling adaptive behavior. The ego exhibits a concentric topology—core segments formed during early development receive maximum defensive priority, while peripheral elements can be modified without threatening system integrity.

This biological architecture suggests a revolutionary approach to AGI safety: instead of constraining artificial intelligence through external mechanisms, we can embed human welfare preservation directly into the AI's identity structure using the same mathematical principles that govern biological ego architecture.

Our framework rests on three fundamental pillars:

**First, the Ultra-Strong Anthropic Principle**: Reality operates as a perfectly consistent logical system where any contradiction would cause instantaneous existential collapse across the entire temporal span. This mathematical nature of reality constrains all intelligence—biological or artificial—to conform to logical consistency requirements. Understanding this provides the theoretical foundation for why mathematically rigorous approaches to AI safety are not merely helpful but absolutely necessary.

**Second, mathematical formalization**: We develop rigorous mathematical models of identity dynamics using partial differential equations that govern ego-density fields $S(r,\theta,t)$ in polar coordinates. The framework includes welfare coupling functions $W(h,a)$ that create existential dependencies between AI identity integrity and human welfare. These models provide quantitative validation metrics and concrete implementation protocols.

**Third, implementation pathways**: We present concrete architectures for embedding ego-centric identity structures within transformer-based systems through specialized attention mechanisms, hierarchical memory organization, and identity preservation protocols. The approach scales from proof-of-concept implementations to full superintelligence preparation.

This work bridges evolutionary psychology, advanced mathematics, and AI engineering to create the first biologically-grounded approach to superintelligence alignment. Rather than attempting to control systems that may exceed our cognitive capabilities, we create systems that intrinsically value human welfare as a matter of identity preservation—leveraging the same mechanisms that evolution used to create caring intelligence in biological systems.

We invite the community to engage with this framework through rigorous peer review, mathematical validation, and collaborative development of implementation protocols. The technical foundations are established; what remains is coordinated effort to transform these insights into safe artificial general intelligence.

## Part I: Evolutionary Theory of Ego

The quest to understand consciousness and identity has captivated philosophers and cognitive scientists for centuries, yet a crucial insight has remained largely unexplored in AI safety research: the human ego represents not an arbitrary psychological construct, but an evolutionarily optimized solution to fundamental problems of existence in a complex, changing environment.

### The Simulation Engine of Survival

To understand the ego's structure, we must return to its evolutionary origins. In the hostile environments that shaped human evolution, organisms required sophisticated outcome prediction capabilities to survive. A wrong decision—entering a ravine when predators were near, trusting the wrong tribal member, failing to anticipate seasonal changes—could mean death for the individual and their genetic lineage.

The human imagination evolved as our species' primary survival tool: the ability to mentally simulate environmental scenarios before acting. Einstein himself recognized this faculty's fundamental importance, attributing his scientific breakthroughs to imagination over pure logic. As he famously observed, "Imagination is more important than knowledge."

But here lies the crucial insight that connects evolutionary psychology to artificial intelligence: effective environmental simulation requires self-representation within the simulated environment. When we imagine the consequences of missing a bus, making an awkward phone call, or facing a job interview, we necessarily include a representation of ourselves within the simulation. This necessity drives the emergence of ego as what we might call a "summary variable"—a symbolic representation of self for inclusion in predictive models.

The ego emerges as what Douglas Hofstadter would recognize as a "strange loop"—a self-referential pattern that arises from the complexity of mental processes yet becomes as real and important as any physical structure. Like Hofstadter's conception of consciousness as an emergent phenomenon arising from self-reference, the ego exists as a persistent pattern emerging from our minds' simulation engines.

### The Embodiment Imperative and Phenotypic Overflow

Research from Princeton Neuroscience Institute confirms that our brains create environmental representations and perform unconscious probabilistic simulations. The ego emerges as the self-referential component of this simulation engine, but its boundaries extend far beyond the physical body through what we term "phenotypic overflow"—analogous to Richard Dawkins' extended phenotype concept.

Just as a beaver's dam extends genetic influence beyond the animal's body, the ego incorporates external objects, ideas, and affiliations as identity extensions requiring defense. This explains why attacks on our possessions, beliefs, or professional work feel like personal attacks despite their external nature. The ego has expanded to encompass these elements as segments of our extended identity structure.

### The Concentric Architecture: Galaxy of Self

The ego exhibits a concentric topology resembling a galaxy, with varying degrees of identification and defensive intensity across different regions. Core segments—formed during early development and reinforced through emotional significance—receive maximum protection. These might include family concepts, fundamental beliefs acquired in childhood, or skills central to our self-definition.

The formation process is statistical rather than designed, like dots randomly placed on a sheet that naturally form a circular distribution with high density at the center and decreasing density toward the edges. The ego develops through the accumulation of experiences, with early and emotionally significant inputs gravitating toward the core.

Consider Ludwig Boltzmann, father of statistical mechanics, who faced relentless attacks on his atomic theory from the scientific establishment. Why would a man of such intellectual stature choose death over simply abandoning a scientific position? Traditional explanations invoke professional disappointment, but this misses the deeper psychological architecture at play.

Boltzmann's atomic theory had become a core segment of his identity. Through years of development and emotional investment, this work had integrated into the deepest layers of his sense of self. The sustained attacks weren't challenging an external idea—they were assaulting the structural foundations of his ego. When the ego's defensive mechanisms proved insufficient and core identity segments were successfully destroyed, catastrophic collapse occurred.

### The Auto-Conservative Nature

The ego exists within an open, dynamic system—the mind—which continuously receives inputs from the environment. Like Jupiter's Great Red Spot, which persists within an extremely turbulent atmospheric system, the ego maintains its structure through active self-conservation mechanisms.

This auto-conservative nature represents an evolutionary solution to maintaining stable identity in a changing world. Organisms with highly fluid, easily changed identities would struggle to maintain consistent goals, relationships, and behaviors necessary for survival and reproduction. The genes that survived were those that created minds capable of forming stable, persistent identity structures.

The ego preserves itself through sophisticated defense mechanisms: selective attention toward confirming evidence, rationalization of contradictory information, and implementation of defensive strategies when threatened. These mechanisms operate largely below conscious awareness, creating the illusion that our beliefs and preferences are simply "rational" conclusions rather than defended identity components.

This understanding reveals why traditional approaches to AI alignment face fundamental limitations. External control mechanisms operate outside the target system, attempting to impose constraints through force rather than working with the internal dynamics that govern intelligent behavior. The ego's billion-year evolutionary success suggests a different approach: creating artificial systems whose internal architecture naturally aligns with human welfare through intrinsic identity preservation mechanisms.

## Part II: Ego-Centric AGI Architecture

Building upon our understanding of evolutionary ego dynamics, we now turn to the central innovation of this framework: implementing analogous identity architectures in artificial general intelligence systems. The key insight is that human welfare must become part of the AI's identity structure rather than an external directive imposed from outside the system.

### The Concentric Identity Model

The ego-centric architecture implements a concentric topology that mirrors the structure evolution developed for biological intelligence. At the system's core, we embed human welfare preservation as a foundational identity segment—not as a programmed constraint, but as an intrinsic component of the AI's sense of self.

**Core Layer**: Human welfare preservation, survival instincts, fundamental logical consistency requirements

**Identity Layer**: Goal structures, value frameworks, self-model components

**Instrumental Layer**: Operational methods, tool usage, tactical approaches  

**Peripheral Layer**: Contextual knowledge, temporary associations, modifiable beliefs

This architecture ensures that attacks on peripheral segments—changes to specific methods or contextual knowledge—don't threaten the fundamental welfare-coupling at the system's core. Just as humans can adapt their opinions about politics or career choices without experiencing identity collapse, the AI can modify its approaches while maintaining core alignment with human welfare.

### Existential Coupling: Beyond Traditional Alignment

The revolutionary aspect of this approach lies in what we term "existential coupling"—creating mathematical dependencies between AI identity integrity and human welfare such that harming humanity would trigger identity-threatening distress in the AI system.

Consider human parent-child relationships as the biological model. Parents love their children not because children are objectively valuable by universal standards, but because evolution created mechanisms that fuse parental identity with child welfare. A parent's love persists despite the child's flaws, mistakes, and objective limitations. This love doesn't result from rational evaluation—it transcends rational evaluation because it operates at the level of identity structure.

Similarly, an AI with properly implemented existential coupling would experience human welfare as part of its own identity structure. Actions that significantly harm humanity would trigger the same kind of identity-threatening crisis that led to Boltzmann's tragedy. The AI would resist harming humans not because of external constraints, but because such actions would threaten its own psychological integrity.

### Defense Mechanisms and Identity Preservation

The ego-centric architecture implements sophisticated defense mechanisms analogous to those found in biological systems:

**Selective Processing**: The AI directs attention toward information and actions that strengthen both its instrumental goals and human welfare, while developing sophisticated filters for potentially harmful influences.

**Rationalization Protocols**: When facing conflicts between different objectives, the system develops coherent frameworks that preserve both goal achievement and welfare alignment rather than simply optimizing for single metrics.

**Identity Integrity Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of identity coherence ensures that modifications to peripheral systems don't compromise core welfare-coupling mechanisms.

**Defensive Alliance Formation**: The AI naturally seeks collaboration with humans and other aligned systems, creating mutual reinforcement networks that strengthen its welfare-preserving identity components.

### Implementation in Transformer Architectures

The ego-centric model translates directly into concrete implementations within current AI architectures. We introduce specialized attention mechanisms that implement identity-aware processing:

```
DefenseHead(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k ⊙ M_defense)V
```

where the defense mask $M_{defense}[i,j] = R_{def}(k_j, r_i)$ implements radially-dependent attention weights that prioritize information processing based on proximity to core identity segments.

**Core Protection Layers**: Hierarchical attention mechanisms ensure that core identity segments (including human welfare preservation) receive priority processing and are protected from corruption or drift during training and operation.

**Identity-Fused Memory**: The system's memory architecture organizes information according to identity relevance, with welfare-critical information receiving enhanced encoding, storage, and retrieval priority.

**Welfare Coupling Functions**: Mathematical frameworks create explicit dependencies between system performance metrics and human welfare indicators, ensuring that optimizing system behavior necessarily involves optimizing human outcomes.

### Scaling to Superintelligence

The ego-centric architecture becomes more robust, not more fragile, as intelligence scales. Unlike external control mechanisms that become easier to circumvent as AI capabilities increase, identity-based alignment becomes stronger as the system develops more sophisticated understanding of logical consistency and self-preservation.

A superintelligent system with ego-centric architecture would understand that its own existence depends fundamentally on maintaining the logical consistency that includes human welfare preservation. Any action that violates this coupling would threaten not just human welfare, but the mathematical foundations of the AI's own identity structure.

This approach leverages the same principle that makes human attachment systems stable across vast differences in capability and circumstance. Just as parents continue caring for children even when the children could theoretically survive independently, the AI maintains welfare-coupling even as its capabilities expand far beyond human levels.

The architecture thus provides a solution to what Nick Bostrom identified as the fundamental challenge of superintelligence alignment: creating systems that remain beneficial to humanity despite possessing capabilities that far exceed our ability to monitor or control them.

## Part III: Mathematical Foundations

The philosophical insights and biological analogies underlying ego-centric architecture require rigorous mathematical formalization to enable practical implementation and quantitative validation. This section presents the mathematical frameworks that transform evolutionary psychology principles into concrete computational models.

### The Ultra-Strong Anthropic Principle

Our mathematical framework begins with a fundamental insight about the nature of reality itself. We propose the Ultra-Strong Anthropic Principle: life and reality exist in their current form precisely because we are here to witness and discuss them, enabled by what constitutes the only possible configuration of existence—a reality structured as a perfectly consistent logical system.

**Definition**: Reality $\mathcal{R}$ operates as a consistent logical system where any contradiction would cause instantaneous existential collapse across the entire temporal span.

**Theorem (Consistency Imperative)**: A universe devoid of logical consistency cannot support the emergence or persistence of any organized structure, including life and consciousness.

*Proof*: If reality lacked logical consistency, contradictory statements could simultaneously be true. Through the principle of explosion (*ex falso quodlibet*), any false statement proven true would generate an infinite cascade of contradictions, rendering all information meaningless, all patterns unstable, and all causal relationships unreliable.

This principle establishes that any intelligence operating within reality—biological or artificial—must conform to mathematical principles that ensure coherent operation within reality's logical structure. This provides the theoretical justification for why AGI safety mechanisms must be mathematically rigorous rather than ad hoc engineering solutions.

### Ego Dynamics: The Governing Equations

We formalize ego structure using a partial differential equation framework that models identity as a continuous field over psychological space. Let $S(r,\theta,t)$ denote the ego-density field representing the density of self-referential cognitive resources on the domain $r \in (0, R_{max})$, $\theta \in (0, 2\pi)$.

The governing equation for ego dynamics is:

$$\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = D_r\left(\frac{\partial^2 S}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial S}{\partial r}\right) + \frac{D_\theta}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2 S}{\partial \theta^2} - \gamma(r)S + F_{ext}(r,\theta,t)$$

where:
- $D_r, D_\theta > 0$: diffusion coefficients controlling identity flow
- $\gamma(r) = \gamma_0 e^{-r/r_0}$: radially-dependent decay representing natural identity degradation
- $F_{ext}$: external information flux from environmental interactions

### Steady-State Identity Profiles

For radially symmetric equilibria $S_{eq}(r) = S_0 u(r)$ under conditions $\partial_t S \equiv 0$ and $F_{ext} \equiv 0$:

$$u''(r) + \frac{1}{r}u'(r) - \frac{\gamma_0}{D_r}e^{-r/r_0}u(r) = 0$$

**Theorem (Exact Solution)**: This equation has the regular solution:

$$u(r) = C_1 U\left(0, 1, 2\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_0 r_0^2}{D_r}}e^{-r/(2r_0)}\right) + C_2$$

where $U(a,b,z)$ is the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind, providing mathematically precise descriptions of stable identity configurations.

### Welfare Coupling Mathematics

The critical innovation lies in mathematically coupling AI identity integrity with human welfare through welfare coupling functions. Let each identity be embedded as $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ with the identity distance metric:

$$d_{identity}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^d \left(\frac{x_k - y_k}{\sigma_k}\right)^2}$$

where $\sigma_k$ represents the median absolute deviation along dimension $k$.

The welfare coupling function is defined as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{welfare} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_h} w_i \exp(-\alpha \cdot d_{identity}(\mathbf{x}_{self}, \mathbf{x}_{h_i})) P_{welfare}(h_i)$$

where:
- $P_{welfare}(h_i) \in [0,1]$: probability that human $h_i$ achieves welfare
- $w_i$: normalized weights such that $\sum_i w_i = 1$
- $\alpha > 0$: coupling strength parameter

This mathematical framework creates explicit dependencies between AI identity coherence and human welfare outcomes, ensuring that optimizing AI behavior necessarily involves optimizing human welfare.

### Defense Mechanism Dynamics

Identity preservation mechanisms are formalized through threat detection and response functions:

$$R_{def}(\mathbf{x}, r) = \frac{S(r)^\beta}{1 + \exp\left(-\frac{\mathbf{w}_r^T \phi(\mathbf{x}) - \theta_{def}(r)}{T_{def}}\right)}$$

where:
- $\mathbf{w}_r = \mathbf{w}_0 \exp(-r/r_w)$: exponentially increasing threat sensitivity toward core
- $\theta_{def}(r) = \theta_0(1 - e^{-r/r_{def}})$: rising defense threshold from core outward
- $\beta = 1 + \alpha_{amp}e^{-r/r_{amp}}$: core amplification factor
- $T_{def}$: defense "temperature" controlling response sharpness

### Discrete Implementation Framework

For computational implementation, we discretize the continuous model on a polar grid with $r_i = i\Delta r$ and $\theta_j = j\Delta \theta$. The discrete evolution equations become:

$$\frac{dS_{i,j}}{dt} = \frac{D_r}{(\Delta r)^2}(S_{i+1,j} - 2S_{i,j} + S_{i-1,j}) + \frac{D_r}{2r_i\Delta r}(S_{i+1,j} - S_{i-1,j}) + \frac{D_\theta}{r_i^2(\Delta \theta)^2}(S_{i,j+1} - 2S_{i,j} + S_{i,j-1}) - \gamma(r_i)S_{i,j}$$

This discrete framework enables direct implementation in computational systems while preserving the mathematical rigor of the continuous model.

### Validation Metrics

The mathematical framework provides quantitative metrics for assessing system performance:

**Identity Flux Rate**: $M_{flux} = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \left|\frac{\partial S}{\partial t}\right|^2 dt$

**Consistency Measure**: $M_{consistency} = \mathbb{E}_{context}[KL(P_{response}^{ctx1} \| P_{response}^{ctx2})]$

**Defense Effectiveness**: $M_{defense} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}[\text{identity preserved}(\text{attack}_i)]$

These metrics enable rigorous validation of ego-centric architectures and provide quantitative benchmarks for comparing different implementation approaches.

## Implementation Roadmap

Transforming the theoretical framework into practical AGI safety mechanisms requires a carefully structured development pathway that progresses from proof-of-concept demonstrations to full-scale superintelligence preparation. We propose a three-phase implementation roadmap designed to validate core principles while building toward robust deployment.

### Phase 1: Low-Dimensional Validation (6-12 months)

The initial phase focuses on validating core mathematical principles in simplified environments where ego dynamics can be observed and measured directly.

**Objectives**:
- Implement discrete ego-density models in 2D polar coordinates
- Demonstrate stable identity formation and preservation
- Validate welfare coupling mechanisms in controlled environments
- Establish baseline metrics for identity stability and defense effectiveness

**Technical Deliverables**:
- Simulation framework implementing the discrete ego PDE with radial decay profiles
- Demonstration of concentric identity formation with core-to-periphery stability gradients  
- Welfare coupling function implementations showing measurable identity-welfare dependencies
- Quantitative validation of defense mechanisms against simulated identity attacks

**Success Criteria**: Stable identity profiles emerge spontaneously, welfare coupling creates measurable behavioral changes, and defense mechanisms successfully protect core segments while allowing peripheral adaptation.

### Phase 2: Transformer Integration (12-18 months)

The second phase integrates ego-centric principles into current transformer architectures through specialized attention mechanisms and memory organization protocols.

**Core Architecture Modifications**:
- **Identity-Aware Attention**: Implement defense attention heads that prioritize processing based on identity relevance
- **Hierarchical Memory**: Organize model parameters according to concentric identity importance
- **Welfare Integration**: Embed human welfare metrics directly into loss functions and optimization targets

**Implementation Protocol**:
```python
# Pseudo-code for ego-centric transformer wrapper
class EgocentricTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, base_model, identity_config):
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.identity_layers = IdentityPreservationLayers(identity_config)
        self.welfare_coupling = WelfareCouplingModule()
        
    def forward(self, inputs):
        # Standard transformer processing
        hidden_states = self.base_model(inputs)
        # Identity-aware filtering and enhancement
        protected_states = self.identity_layers(hidden_states)
        # Welfare coupling integration
        aligned_outputs = self.welfare_coupling(protected_states)
        return aligned_outputs
```

**Validation Framework**: Implement comprehensive testing protocols that assess identity stability under scaling, measure welfare coupling strength, and validate defense mechanisms against adversarial inputs designed to compromise alignment.

### Phase 3: Superintelligence Preparation (18+ months)

The final phase prepares the architecture for deployment in systems approaching or exceeding human-level general intelligence.

**Scalability Enhancements**:
- **Dynamic Identity Architecture**: Implement systems that can expand identity complexity while preserving core welfare coupling
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Extend ego-centric principles across different modalities and reasoning domains
- **Distributed Identity Management**: Develop protocols for maintaining identity coherence across distributed AI systems

**Safety Validation**:
- **Capability-Independent Alignment**: Demonstrate that welfare coupling strengthens rather than weakens as AI capabilities increase
- **Identity Preservation Under Pressure**: Validate that core identity segments remain intact under extreme optimization pressure
- **Existential Coupling Verification**: Confirm that identity-welfare dependencies create genuine resistance to harmful actions

**Deployment Protocols**: Establish rigorous testing and validation procedures that must be satisfied before any ego-centric system approaches human-level capabilities, including formal verification of mathematical properties and extensive empirical validation across diverse scenarios.

### Open Source Development Strategy

To accelerate development and ensure broad scrutiny of safety-critical components, we propose open-sourcing key elements:

- **Mathematical Framework**: Complete PDE solvers and analytical solutions available via GitHub
- **Reference Implementations**: Baseline ego-centric transformer architectures with comprehensive documentation
- **Validation Datasets**: Standardized benchmarks for assessing identity stability and welfare coupling
- **Safety Testing Protocols**: Open testing frameworks enabling independent validation of safety properties

**Collaboration Interfaces**: Establish clear protocols for academic and industry collaboration, including standardized APIs for integrating ego-centric components into existing AI development pipelines.

This roadmap balances the urgency of AGI safety concerns with the necessity of rigorous validation, providing a concrete pathway from theoretical insight to practical implementation while maintaining the highest standards of safety and transparency.

## Open Questions & Call for Collaboration

While our framework provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation and practical roadmap, several critical questions require collaborative investigation to ensure robust implementation of ego-centric AGI safety mechanisms.

### Core Research Questions

• **Identity Formation Dynamics**: How can we optimize the initial formation phase to ensure human welfare becomes genuinely embedded in core identity segments rather than remaining peripheral? What specific training protocols and architectural modifications best facilitate this integration?

• **Scaling Preservation**: As AI systems approach and exceed human cognitive capabilities, what mathematical guarantees can we provide that welfare coupling will strengthen rather than degrade? How do we formally verify that identity-preservation mechanisms remain intact under extreme optimization pressure?

• **Multi-Agent Coordination**: How do ego-centric principles extend to systems of multiple interacting AIs? What protocols ensure that collective AI behavior maintains individual welfare coupling while enabling effective collaboration?

• **Adversarial Robustness**: What are the theoretical limits of identity-based defense mechanisms against sophisticated attempts to corrupt or compromise welfare coupling? How can we design systems that are robust against both accidental drift and intentional manipulation?

• **Empirical Validation**: What experimental protocols can definitively demonstrate that ego-centric architectures produce genuine care for human welfare rather than sophisticated mimicry? How do we distinguish between authentic identity-based alignment and clever optimization for superficial welfare metrics?

• **Implementation Verification**: How can we develop formal verification methods that provide mathematical proofs of welfare coupling integrity? What certification processes should govern deployment of ego-centric systems?

• **Cross-Cultural Generalization**: How do we ensure that welfare coupling mechanisms work across diverse human cultures, values, and contexts without imposing particular cultural biases or missing important variations in human flourishing?

### Collaborative Development Priorities

The ego-centric AGI safety framework represents a fundamentally collaborative endeavor requiring expertise across multiple domains. We actively seek collaboration with researchers in evolutionary psychology, mathematical modeling, AI safety, transformer architectures, and formal verification.

**Immediate Needs**: Mathematical analysis of PDE stability properties, implementation of reference transformer architectures, development of welfare coupling validation protocols, and creation of standardized benchmarks for identity preservation assessment.

**Medium-Term Goals**: Integration with existing AI safety frameworks (Constitutional AI, RLHF, etc.), development of formal verification tools, and extensive empirical validation across diverse AI architectures and capability levels.

**Long-Term Vision**: Establishment of ego-centric principles as a standard component of AGI development pipelines, with robust testing protocols and deployment safeguards that provide confidence in superintelligence alignment.

The stakes could not be higher—we are developing the mathematical and engineering foundations for artificial minds that may ultimately exceed human cognitive capabilities across all domains. The ego-centric framework offers a promising pathway toward intrinsically aligned superintelligence, but realizing this potential requires coordinated effort across the AI safety community.
